These are examples of how using a buffer, to allow multiple +attacks and +defends as just one tick on buff duration, might play out in a scene where the buffed player is fighting multiple opponents.

Buffer window: 3 minutes
We're only focusing on UN1 as they are the only person fighting multiple opponents.

Round 1:
00:00 	- UN1 poses
00:00 	- UN1 is successfully buffed for 3 duration (3 duration left)
07:30 	- Pirate1 poses
07:30 	- Pirate1 +attacks UN1
10:20 	- Pirate2 poses
10:20	- Pirate2 +attacks UN1
14:10	- Pirate3 poses
14:10	- Pirate3 +attacks UN1

Round 2:
15:40	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate3 (no existing buffer, buffer starts at 15:40)
16:10	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate2
16:40	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate1
23:10	- UN1 poses
23:10	- UN1 +attacks Pirate1
23:20	- UN1 +attacks Pirate2
23:30	- UN1 +attacks Pirate3
25:50	- Pirate1 +defends against UN1(buffed) (previous buffer of 15:40 has expired, -1 duration, 2 duration left, new buffer starts at 23:10)
26:10	- Pirate2 +defends against UN1(buffed) (this +attack was made at 23:20, within the 23:10 buffer)
32:30	- Pirate3 +defends against UN1(buffed) (Although the +defend takes place much later, still counts as within the buffer as the +attack was made at 23:30)
33:10	- Pirate1 poses
33:10	- Pirate1 +attacks UN1
34:20	- Pirate2 poses
34:20	- Pirate2 +attacks UN1
39:00	- Pirate3 poses
39:00	- Pirate3 +attacks UN1

Round3:
40:10	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate3 (previous buffer of 23:10 has expired, -1 duration, 1 duration left, new buffer starts at 40:10)
40:30	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate2
41:00	- UN1(buffed) +defends against Pirate1
49:00	- UN1 poses
49:00	- UN1 +attacks Pirate1
49:40	- UN1 +attacks Pirate2
50:20	- UN1 +attacks Pirate3
52:10	- Pirate1 +defends against UN1(unbuffed) (previous buffer of 40:10 has expired, -1 duration, 0 duration left, no new buffer)
54:40	- Pirate2 +defends against UN1(unbuffed)
55:20	- Pirate3 +defends against UN1(unbuffed)


The result is that the buff lasted long enough for UN1 to make three buffed action groups. He was buffed when he defended against the pirate attacks from the first round. He was buffed when he made the attacks against the pirates in the second round, and he was buffed when he defended against the pirates in the third round. He was NOT buffed when he attacked the pirates in the third round.
