Weapon Design:

--Initial Notes--

All vehicles will have a built in H2H weapon. If this isn't suitable for a vehicle in some way, can just use a 0 damage amount and name it 'Unusued' or something.


--Design--

Type|Name|Accuracy|Damage Type|Damage|Max Ammo|Current Ammo|Ammo Use|Internal/Hardpoint


Type: R (Ranged) / M (Missile) / C (Melee) / H (H2H)

Name: Whatever you want (about 22 chars max)

Accuracy: Whole number, positive or negative. Remember that higher attack levels multiply this number.

Damage Type: Right now all we've really got is 'HP'. Though I imagine this'll be expanded further in the future.

Damage: Base damage amount.

Max Ammo, Current Ammo: In the case of weapons without ammo (energy, melee) use I for infinite.

Ammo Use: How much ammo a level 1 attack uses. In the case of weapons without ammo, MUST BE 0

Internal/Hardpoint: I for internal. Nothing else.
		    H works with nothing else too, but also can be expanded.
H:<space seperated list>

H:XY`C>-1 (reduces vehicle speed by 1)
H:XY`C>-1 XY`E>-2 (reduces vehicle speed by 1, stealth by 2)

XY`A: Armor
XY`B: Targeting
XY`C: Speed
XY`D: Intercept
XY`E: Stealth
XY`F: Sensors
XY`G: Spritia Amp.
